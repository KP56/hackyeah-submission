# Automation Flag Fix - Debug Summary

## Problem Identified
The `currently_executing_automation` flag could get stuck at `True` after script execution, preventing future automations from working properly.

## Root Cause
In `backend/src/main.py`, the `confirm_and_execute` function had a critical bug:

```python
# Old code (BUGGY):
suggestion["status"] = "executing"

# Mark as currently executing
with automation_execution_lock:
    currently_executing_automation = True

# Execute the script with retry logic
if automation_executor:
    try:
        # ... execution logic ...
    finally:
        # Reset flag
        currently_executing_automation = False
else:
    raise HTTPException(...)  # BUG: Flag never reset!
```

**The Issue:** If `automation_executor` was `None`, the code would raise an exception **before** entering the try-finally block, so the flag would never be reset to `False`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed the Flag Reset Logic** (backend/src/main.py)
- Moved the `automation_executor` check **before** setting the flag to `True`
- Ensured the try-finally block **always** wraps the entire execution path
- Now the flag is guaranteed to be reset in all scenarios (success, failure, exception)

```python
# New code (FIXED):
# Check if automation_executor is available BEFORE setting the flag
if not automation_executor:
    raise HTTPException(...)

# Mark as currently executing
with automation_execution_lock:
    currently_executing_automation = True

# Execute the script (wrapped in try-finally)
try:
    execution_result = automation_executor.execute_automation(...)
    # ... handle results ...
finally:
    # THIS ALWAYS RUNS - even if exception is raised
    with automation_execution_lock:
        currently_executing_automation = False
```

### 2. **Added Comprehensive Debug Logging**

#### In `backend/src/main.py` - `confirm_and_execute()`:
- ✓ Logs when execution starts with current flag state
- ✓ Logs when flag is set to `True`
- ✓ Logs script execution progress
- ✓ Logs success/failure with details
- ✓ Logs when flag is reset to `False` in finally block
- ✓ Logs final flag state after execution

#### In `backend/src/automation_executor.py` - `execute_automation()`:
- ✓ Logs execution start with script preview
- ✓ Logs library requirements and installation
- ✓ Logs each attempt number and result
- ✓ Logs success with output preview
- ✓ Logs failures with error details
- ✓ Logs execution completion

#### In `backend/src/main.py` - `register_file_operation_as_action()`:
- ✓ Logs when file operations are SKIPPED (automation running)
- ✓ Logs when file operations are REGISTERED (normal mode)

#### In `backend/src/main.py` - `on_key_sequence()`:
- ✓ Logs when keyboard input is SKIPPED (automation running)

## Expected Debug Output

When an automation runs, you should see output like this:

```
================================================================================
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Starting execution for suggestion: suggestion_123456789_0
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Current automation flag before: False
================================================================================

[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Suggestion status changed to: executing
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] ✓ Set currently_executing_automation = True
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Starting script execution...
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Script length: 523 characters

[AutomationExecutor] ====== STARTING EXECUTION #1 ======
[AutomationExecutor] User explanation: Rename all my vacation photos
[AutomationExecutor] Script preview: import os...
[AutomationExecutor] Required libraries: None

[AutomationExecutor] --- Attempt 1/3 ---
[AutomationExecutor] Created temporary script file: C:\Temp\tmpx7z3k2.py
[AutomationExecutor] Attempt 1 result: success=True, return_code=0
[AutomationExecutor] ✓ Cleaned up temp file: C:\Temp\tmpx7z3k2.py
[AutomationExecutor] ✓✓✓ Execution SUCCESSFUL on attempt 1
[AutomationExecutor] Output: Renamed 15 files successfully
[AutomationExecutor] ====== EXECUTION #1 COMPLETE ======

[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Script execution completed
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Success: True
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] ✓ Execution successful - status set to completed
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Time saved: 300 seconds (5.0 minutes)
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] ✓ Reset currently_executing_automation = False (in finally block)

================================================================================
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Execution completed for suggestion: suggestion_123456789_0
[AUTOMATION EXECUTE] Final automation flag: False
================================================================================
```

If automation is running, file operations will be skipped:
```
[FILE WATCHER] ⊘ SKIPPED file operation (automation running): created | C:\vacation_001.jpg
[FILE WATCHER] ⊘ SKIPPED file operation (automation running): created | C:\vacation_002.jpg
```

## How to Use Debug Info

1. **If automation seems stuck:** Look for whether the flag is reset in the finally block
2. **If file operations are being detected during automation:** Check if the "SKIPPED" messages appear
3. **If script fails:** Check the AutomationExecutor logs for detailed error messages
4. **If flag is never reset:** You'll see flag=True in the final state log

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run an automation that succeeds - verify flag is reset
2. Run an automation that fails - verify flag is reset
3. Trigger an error condition - verify flag is reset
4. Check file operations during execution - verify they're skipped
5. Run another automation after the first - verify it works properly
