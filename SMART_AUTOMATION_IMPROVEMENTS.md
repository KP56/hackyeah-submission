# Smart Automation System - Improved Selectivity

## Overview
Enhanced the short-term pattern detection agent to be **much more selective** and only suggest automations when truly meaningful, repetitive patterns are detected.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Stricter Prompt Guidelines**
The AI now has explicit instructions to:

**üö´ REJECT patterns like:**
- Just switching between apps (Alt+Tab)
- Simple navigation or browsing
- Single copy-paste operations
- Random, unrelated actions
- Less than 3 meaningful repetitive actions
- Normal computer usage without clear workflow

**‚úÖ ACCEPT patterns like:**
- Repetitive file operations (3+ similar files)
- Data transfer workflows (Excel ‚Üí Word repeatedly)
- Batch processing (same operation on multiple items)
- Clear sequential patterns (3-4 step process repeated)
- Tedious repetitive tasks that waste time

### 2. **Code-Level Pre-Filtering**
Before even calling the AI, the system now:

```python
# Requires at least 3 actions (up from 2)
# Requires at least 2 "substantive" actions (not just app switches)

Pre-filter checks:
‚úì Reject if all actions are just app switches
‚úì Reject if less than 2 substantive actions
‚úì Look for 3+ identical file operations
‚úì Look for 2+ copy-paste cycles
‚úì Look for app switching WITH substantive work
```

### 3. **Smart Action Classification**

**Substantive Actions** (meaningful work):
- File operations (create, move, rename, delete)
- Keyboard shortcuts (copy, paste, save, etc.)

**Non-Substantive Actions** (navigation):
- App switches (opening apps, Alt+Tab)
- Window focus changes

### 4. **Examples**

#### ‚úÖ WILL Suggest Automation:
1. **Repetitive File Renaming**
   - User renames 5 image files: `IMG001.jpg ‚Üí Photo_1.jpg`
   - Pattern: Clear renaming pattern on multiple files
   
2. **Excel ‚Üí Word Data Transfer**
   - User copies from Excel, switches to Word, pastes (√ó3 times)
   - Pattern: Repetitive data transfer workflow

3. **Batch File Organization**
   - User creates folder, moves 4 files into it, repeats for 3 folders
   - Pattern: Clear organizational workflow

#### ‚ùå WON'T Suggest Automation:
1. **Just Switching Apps**
   - User opens Chrome, then Excel, then Word
   - Reason: Just navigation, no repetitive work

2. **Single Operation**
   - User copies from one app and pastes into another (once)
   - Reason: Not repetitive, just normal usage

3. **Random Actions**
   - User opens file, switches app, presses Ctrl+S
   - Reason: No clear pattern or workflow

## Technical Details

### Minimum Requirements for Pattern Detection:
- **Minimum Actions**: 3 (up from 2)
- **Minimum Substantive Actions**: 2
- **Repetition Threshold**: 
  - 3+ identical file operations, OR
  - 2+ copy-paste cycles, OR
  - 5+ substantive actions total

### Time Savings Threshold:
- Pattern must save at least **30 seconds** of manual work
- Must be specific enough to actually automate

### Cooldown Period:
- 60 seconds between suggestions (prevents spam)
- User can mute for 10+ minutes if needed

## Benefits

1. **Fewer False Positives**: No more suggestions for trivial actions
2. **Better User Experience**: Only interrupted when truly helpful
3. **Cost Savings**: Fewer LLM API calls for trivial patterns
4. **Higher Quality**: Suggestions are more actionable and valuable

## Configuration

All thresholds are configurable in `short_term_pattern_agent.py`:

```python
# Minimum actions needed
MIN_ACTIONS = 3

# Minimum substantive actions
MIN_SUBSTANTIVE_ACTIONS = 2

# Cooldown between suggestions
SUGGESTION_COOLDOWN = 60  # seconds
```

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the improvements work:

### Should NOT trigger:
- Alt+Tab between 3-4 apps
- Open a few files
- Single copy-paste
- Browse file explorer

### SHOULD trigger:
- Rename 3+ files with pattern
- Copy from Excel to Word 3+ times
- Move 3+ files to similar folders
- Repeat same 3-step process multiple times
