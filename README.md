# Hackyeah Automation Assistant

A modern desktop application that combines FastAPI backend with Electron + React frontend for intelligent file monitoring and email automation.

## How to open?
You have two choices:
1. Predefined exe files
2. Source code

For the predefined exe files, they do not support automating: the agents will detect patterns, but will be unable to automate them and may have some GUI functionalities outdated.
If you decide to run the source code directly, you will have access to all current functionalities.

## Running the exe files
You just need to run both exe files. It may take some time before the frontend appears.

## Running the source code
The user must have Python and npm installed.

To run the source code, it is enough to execute the 'npm install' command in the frontend directory and 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in the backend directory.

Then, it is enough to just execute 'npm run dev' in the frontend directory.

## API keys
To run the program, you need a Gemini API key and a Nylas API key.
